# TRIAGE続 Framework

## Transform Your SOC Signal Management

TRIAGE続 is a revolutionary 3-dimensional, data-driven methodology designed to optimize Security Operations Center (SOC) signals. By combining three powerful metrics, it helps security teams reduce alert fatigue and improve detection accuracy.

### The Three Dimensions

1. **False Positive Probability (P_fp)**
   - Quantifies signal reliability
   - Based on historical data analysis
   - Enables data-driven tuning decisions

2. **Recurrence Frequency (R_freq)**
   - Measures signal patterns over time
   - Normalizes frequency across time windows
   - Identifies persistent issues

3. **Suppression Impact (I_suppress)**
   - Evaluates tuning consequences
   - Ensures critical signals aren't lost
   - Balances noise reduction with coverage

### Why TRIAGE続?

- **Vendor Agnostic**: Works with any SIEM/SOAR platform
- **Data-Driven**: Based on actual signal patterns
- **Practical**: Designed by SOC practitioners for SOC practitioners
- **Scalable**: Adapts to organizations of any size
