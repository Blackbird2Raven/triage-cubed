# TRIAGE³ Framework

A revolutionary 3-dimensional, data-driven methodology for optimizing Security Operations Center (SOC) signals.

## Overview

TRIAGE³ helps detection engineers and SOC analysts:
- Reduce alert fatigue by up to 60%
- Improve detection accuracy
- Optimize resource allocation
- Make data-driven tuning decisions

## The Three Dimensions

1. **False Positive Probability (P_fp)**
   - Quantifies signal reliability
   - Based on historical data analysis
   - Enables data-driven tuning decisions

2. **Recurrence Frequency (R_freq)**
   - Measures signal patterns over time
   - Normalizes frequency across time windows
   - Identifies persistent issues

3. **Suppression Impact (I_suppress)**
   - Evaluates tuning consequences
   - Ensures critical signals aren't lost
   - Balances noise reduction with coverage

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Blackbird2Raven/triage-cubed.git
   cd triage-cubed
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the analyzer:
   ```bash
   python src/signal_analyzer.py
   ```
